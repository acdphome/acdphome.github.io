<div class="block">Defines the database and provides the <a href="#open(java.nio.file.Path,int,boolean,acdp.design.ICipherFactory)"><code>open(java.nio.file.Path, int, boolean, acdp.design.ICipherFactory)</code></a> method.
 <p>
 A database comprises a collection of <a href="Table.html" title="interface in acdp">tables</a>.
 The configuration of a database is contained in the <em>database
 <a href="misc/Layout.html" title="class in acdp.misc">layout</a></em>.
 <p>
 An instance of this class can be obtained by opening the database as a
 weakly typed database (see below) and applying the following usage pattern:
 
 <pre>
 try (Database db = Database.open(...) {
    Table myTable = db.getTable("MyTable");
    <em>do something with</em> myTable
 }</pre>
 
 <h1>Weakly and Strongly Typed</h1>
 A database can be <a href="#open(java.nio.file.Path,int,boolean,acdp.design.ICipherFactory)">opened as a weakly typed</a> or <a href="design/CustomDatabase.html" title="class in acdp.design">strongly typed database</a>.
 An instance of this class is called a <em>weakly typed database</em> because
 the first access to a specific table of the database can only be done by the
 name of the table or by its position within the list of table layouts
 contained in the database layout, see the <a href="#getTable(java.lang.String)"><code>getTable(String)</code></a> and
 <a href="#getTables()"><code>getTables()</code></a> methods.
 Changing the name of the table or changing the position of the table in the
 list of table layouts, without adapting the code on the client side, breaks
 the client code.
 Even worse, the compiler has no chance to detect such inconsistencies.
 Another drawback is that the tables of a weakly typed database are
 themselves weakly typed.
 (See section "Weakly and Strongly Typed" in the <code>Table</code> interface
 description to learn about weakly and strongly typed tables.)
 <p>
 In contrast to this, a <em>strongly typed database</em> is an instance of a
 class extending the <a href="design/CustomDatabase.html" title="class in acdp.design"><code>CustomDatabase</code></a> class.
 An elaborated custom database class can provide tailor-made methods for
 dealing with all kinds of aspects of cross-entity-specific persistence
 management.
 Opening a database as a strongly typed database creates its tables as
 strongly typed tables.
 Doing something with a particular table of a strongly typed database is
 simply doing it with the appropriate table instance which is an
 instance of a class extending the <a href="design/CustomTable.html" title="class in acdp.design"><code>CustomTable</code></a> class.
 <p>
 Opening a database as a weakly typed database can be done from the
 information saved in the database layout only.
 Therefore, ACDP does not need to know of a custom database class or of any
 custom table classes in order to open a database as a weakly typed database.
 Typically, a database is opened as a weakly typed database if there is no
 need for making any reference to the concrete entities the tables represent,
 for example, consider a tool which displays the persisted data of an
 arbitrary database without making any reference to a concrete entity.
 
 <h1>WR and RO Database</h1>
 A <em>WR database</em> (<em>RO database</em>) is a database where all of its
 tables are associated with a <em>WR store</em> (<em>RO store</em>),
 respectively.
 See section "Store" in the description of the <code>Table</code> interface to
 learn more about these two types of store.
 In a WR database that is not write protected, the database's tables support
 insert, delete and update operations.
 In an RO database or a write protected WR database such operations are not
 supported.
 Furthermore, a WR database consists of several files, including a separate
 file containing the layout of the database, whereas an RO database is backed
 by just one database file.
 Invoking the <a href="#createRO(java.nio.file.Path,acdp.design.ICipherFactory)"><code>createRO(java.nio.file.Path, acdp.design.ICipherFactory)</code></a> method converts a WR database to an RO
 database.
 
 <h1>Units</h1>
 An <a href="Unit.html" title="interface in acdp">ACDP unit</a> can be compared to the well-known database
 transaction.
 The main differences are:
 
 <ul>
        <li>Transactions running in different threads may interleave.
        Units, on the other hand, act as a monitor: Units in different threads
        are executed serially.</li>
        <li>Nested units work as expected: If a sequence of write operations needs
        to be rolled back and this sequence of write operations contains
        other sequences of write operations in nested units then these
        sequences of committed write operations are rolled back as well.
        On the other hand, no write operation in any outer unit is affected
        if a sequence of write operations of a nested unit needs to be rolled
        back.</li>
    <li>Reasonably, a unit contains at least one write operation.
        Units generally don't make sense if the database is read-only.
        To cope with <em>view inconsistencies</em> ACDP provides a different
        concept, the so called <em>read zones</em> (see below) which have an
        effect even across common transaction boundaries.
        This is important because isolation ("ACID - Atomicity, Consistency,
        Isolation, Durability") can be an issue beyond the scope of a 
        transaction.</li>
    <li>In a multi-threaded environment, transactions may be automatically
        rolled back at any time "by the system" due to deadlock resolution,
        leaving the client in the delicate situation to restart the
        transaction (tricky in praxis!) or abort the process.
        In contrast, a client of an ACDP database never has to worry
        about restarting a unit due to an intervention of the system.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 A write operation, that is, an <a href="Table.html#insert(java.lang.Object...)">insert</a>,
 <a href="Table.html#delete(acdp.Ref)">delete</a>, <a href="Table.html#update(acdp.Ref,acdp.ColVal...)">update</a>,
 <a href="Table.html#updateAll(acdp.ColVal...)">updateAll</a>, <a href="Table.html#updateAllSupplyValues(acdp.Column,acdp.Table.ValueSupplier)">updateAllSupplyValues</a> or <a href="Table.html#updateAllChangeValues(acdp.Column,acdp.Table.ValueChanger)">updateAllChangeValues</a> operation, executed
 outside a unit is called a <em>Kamikaze write</em>.
 Kamikaze writes outperform write operations executed within a unit but their
 effects on the database can not be rolled back.
 Nevertheless, ACDP takes care that Kamikaze writes are safe for use in a
 multi-threaded environment.
 A typical use case of Kamikaze writes is the initial filling of an empty
 table with a large amount of data.
 <p>
 Read the description of the <a href="Unit.html" title="interface in acdp"><code>Unit</code></a> interface to learn more about units
 and the common usage pattern.
 
 <h1>Read Zones</h1>
 A read-only operation, that is, a <a href="Table.html#get(acdp.Ref,acdp.Column...)">get</a>, an <a href="Table.html#iterator(acdp.Column...)">iterate</a>, a <a href="Table.html#numberOfRows()">numberOfRows</a> or
 a terminal operation of a <a href="Table.html#rows(acdp.Column...)">stream pipeline</a> can be
 invoked within a unit or a read zone to ensure that no concurrent writes are
 taken place in the database while the operation is being executed.
 Several read-only operations can be invoked within a read zone to cope with
 all kinds of view inconsistencies.
 Read the description of the <a href="ReadZone.html" title="interface in acdp"><code>ReadZone</code></a> interface to learn more about
 read zones and the common usage pattern.
 
 <h1>Service Operations</h1>
 Besides those <em>regular</em> write and read database operations mentioned
 in the sections "Units" and "Read Zones" above, ACDP provides several
 <em>service</em> operations, most of them available only for a WR database.
 
 <dl>
    <dt>Level 0</dt>
    <dd>These are read-only service operations providing meta information
    about a particular table or the database.
    They can be invoked within a read zone or a unit in order to prevent any
    writes while the service operation is running.
    <p>
    Complete listing: all methods declared in the inner interfaces of the
    <a href="Information.html" title="interface in acdp"><code>Information</code></a> interface.
    Instances of classes implementing the <a href="Information.DatabaseInfo.html" title="interface in acdp"><code>DatabaseInfo</code></a> and <a href="Information.TableInfo.html" title="interface in acdp"><code>TableInfo</code></a> interfaces
    can be obtained by invoking the <a href="#info()"><code>info()</code></a> and <a href="Table.html#info()"><code>Table.info()</code></a> methods, respectively.</dd>
    <dt>Level 1</dt>
    <dd>These are service operations that, as those on level 0, do not change
    the database but generate and save persistent data outside the database.
    Since they run within a read zone by default, invoking them inside a read
    zone or a unit has no effect.
    <p>
    Complete listing: <a href="#createRO(java.nio.file.Path,acdp.design.ICipherFactory)"><code>createRO(java.nio.file.Path, acdp.design.ICipherFactory)</code></a>, <a href="#zip(int,boolean,java.io.OutputStream)"><code>zip(int, boolean, java.io.OutputStream)</code></a>.</dd>
    <dt>Level 2</dt>
    <dd>These are service operations that remove data from the backing files
    of a particular table.
    <p>
    They cannot be invoked inside a read zone or a unit and their effects
    onto the data persisted in the target table and in any other involved
    tables cannot be reverted.
    The integrity of the target table and of any involved tables may be harmed
    if a system crash occurs while a service operation on this level is
    running.
    <p>
    Complete listing: <a href="Table.html#truncate()"><code>Table.truncate()</code></a>, <a href="Table.html#compactVL()"><code>Table.compactVL()</code></a>,
    <a href="Table.html#compactFL()"><code>Table.compactFL()</code></a>.</dd>
    <dt>Level 3</dt>
    <dd>Operations changing the <em>structure</em> of the database or which
    involve the modification of the internal format of some tables' backing
    files are level 3 service operations.
    <p>
    Unlike the other service operations, service operations on this level
    cannot be invoked within a session: The database must be closed at the
    time a level 3 service operation is invoked.
    <p>
    As with a service operation on level 2, the effects onto the data
    persisted in the database when running a service operation on level 3
    cannot be reverted.
    The integrity of the database may be harmed if a running service operation
    on this level throws an exception due to any reason or if a system crash
    occurs.
    It may therefore be a good idea to <a href="#zip(int,boolean,java.io.OutputStream)">backup the
    database</a> before executing a service operation on this level.
    <p>
    Complete listing: All methods declared in the <a href="tools/Refactor.html" title="class in acdp.tools"><code>Refactor</code></a>
    class.
    </dd>
 </dl>
 
 All but the level 0 service operations are <em>synchronized</em>.
 This means that service operations beyond level 0 cannot interfere with any
 other database operation running in parallel.
 
 <h1>Closing</h1>
 Never forget to <a href="#close()">close</a> the database when you are done
 with it.
 Since this interface extends the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.lang" class="externalLink"><code>AutoCloseable</code></a> interface you can
 apply the <em>try-with-resources</em> statement, see the code snippet above.
 
 <h1>Zipping</h1>
 The database can be packed into a single zip-archive-file by invoking the
 <a href="#zip(int,boolean,java.io.OutputStream)"><code>zip(int, boolean, java.io.OutputStream)</code></a> method.
 Conversly, unzipping the generated zip-archive-file restores the database.
 
 <h1>Durability</h1>
 Mass storage devices, especially non-removal ones, usually apply caching
 strategies that defer writing data to the storage medium to an unknown later
 time.
 In case of a system crash this may lead to a loss of data.
 On the other hand, committed changes are expected to be durable even in the
 case of a system crash.
 A common way to cope with this problem is to keep a transaction log:
 After a system crash has occurred all committed transactions relative to a
 checkpoint can be redone with the help of the transaction log.
 To work properly, the transaction log must be saved on stable storage.
 However, most computer disk drives are not considered stable storage.
 Although ACDP logs any <em>before data</em> for rolling back an uncommitted
 unit, it does not log any <em>after data</em>.
 Instead, ACDP provides a switch in the database layout labeled <code>
 forceWriteCommit</code>.
 If set equal to "<code>on</code>" ACDP forces any data changes to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html?is-external=true#force(boolean)" title="class or interface in java.nio.channels" class="externalLink">materialized</a> at the time a sequence of
 write operations is committed.
 While this method guarantees durability in the case of a system crash even
 in an environment that lacks stable storage, it deteriorates performance
 because it interferes with disk controlling policies.
 This is why it can be turned off.
 If this feature is turned off then changes are forced being materialized not
 until the database is <a href="#close()">closed</a>.
 However, you can always force changes being materialized by invoking the
 <a href="#forceWrite()"><code>forceWrite()</code></a> method.
 Note that Kamikaze writes (see section "Units" above) behave insensitive to
 the position of this switch or to an invocation of the <code>forceWrite()</code>
 method: Changes made with Kamikaze writes are never forced being
 materialized, not even when the database is closed.
 (At the time of writing this description, non-volatile RAM-based mass storage
 devices are being discussed, which presumably let the user find out if data
 sent to such a device has been successfully materialized.)

<div class="block">Opens the database as a <em>weakly typed</em> database.
 <p>
 As long as the database is empty, or as soon as it is empty again, the
 type of encryption can be defined (or redefined) with the <code>
 cipherFactory</code> argument.
 <p>
 It is a good idea to treat the returned database instance as a shared
 singleton.
 <p>
 Opening the same database (having the same main database file) more than
 once is possible if the database is an RO database.
 (Read section "WR and RO Database" of this interface description to learn
 more about the two kinds of databases.)
 However, there are limitations if the database is a WR database:
 Opening a WR database more than once within the same process is not
 possible whereas opening a WR database more than once each time in a
 different process is possible if the WR database is opened in
 <em>all</em> processes with write protection turned on <em>and</em>
 provided that the operating system supports <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileLock.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.nio.channels" class="externalLink">shared locks</a>.
 (If it were allowed to open the same WR database in one process with
 write protection turned off and in another process with write protection
 turned on, this would compromise the concept of the <em>read zone</em>.)</div>
<dl>
<dt><span class="paramLabel">Parameters:</span></dt>
<dd><code>mainFile</code> - The main database file, not allowed to be <code>null</code>.
         If the database is a WR database then the main file is identical
         to the layout file.
         Otherwise, the database is an RO database and the main file is
         identical to the one and only one RO database file.</dd>
<dd><code>opMode</code> - The operating mode of the database.
         If the value is equal to zero then the backing table files are
         immediately closed as soon as they become idle.
         If the value is positive and equal to <code>n</code> then the backing
         table files are closed <code>max(10, n)</code> milliseconds after they
         become idle or when the database is closed.
         If the value is equal to -1 then the backing table files once
         opened remain open until the database is closed.
         If the value is equal to -2 then the <em>compressed</em> content
         of an RO database is completely mapped into memory.
         If the value is equal to -3 then the <em>uncompressed</em>
         content of an RO database is completely mapped into memory.
         A value equal to zero is recommended only if the database is a
         WR database and the operating system can't sustain a bunch of
         files all being opened at the same time.
         In a server environment, a positive value is recommended or,
         provided that the database is an RO database and there is enough
         memory available, a value equal to -2 (less memory required, less
         fast) or -3 (more memory required, faster).
         Note that a value equal to -2 or equal to -3 raises an <code>
         IllegalArgumentException</code> if the database is a WR database.</dd>
<dd><code>writeProtect</code> - Protects a WR database from being modified.
         If set to <code>true</code> then no data of the database can be
         inserted, deleted or updated.
         Note that this parameter has no effect if the database is an RO
         database.
         A write protected database needs less system resources than a
         writable database.</dd>

 creates a zip archive file.
 <p>
 In case of an RO database the <a href="#open(java.nio.file.Path,int,boolean,acdp.design.ICipherFactory)">main file</a> is the
 only file related to the database.
 Since the main file of an RO database is already quite compact, zipping
 an RO database generally does not make sense.
 <p>
 If the <code>home</code> argument is set to <code>false</code> then the files
 appear in the resulting zip archive with the path information as
 contained in the database layout with the exception of the main file
 itself which appears with its file name only.
 (Recall that in a WR database the main file and the layout file, hence,
 the file containing the database layout, are identical.)
 <p>
 If the <code>home</code> argument is set to <code>true</code> then the same file
 structure is created as if the <code>home</code> argument was set to <code>
 false</code> but with a single root directory having a name equal to the name
 of the main directory.
 (The main directory is the directory housing the main file.)
 <p>
 For example, if the main file "v" has a path equal to "/a/<b>b</b>/v" (or
 "C:\a\<b>b</b>\v") and some other file "w" of the database has a path
 equal to "/a/<b>b</b>/e/w" (or "C:\a\<b>b</b>\e\w") with <b>b</b> denoting
 the main directory of the database then "v" and "w" will appear in the
 zip archive as "v" and "e/w", respectively, provided that the <code>home</code>
 argument is equal to <code>false</code>.
 If the <code>home</code> argument is equal to <code>true</code> then "v" and "w"
 will appear in the zip archive as "<b>b</b>/v" and "<b>b</b>/e/w",
 respectively.
 <p>
 The database can easily be restored by unzipping the resulting zip archive
 to any directory.
 However, the database can be opened without any prior modifications only
 if the following two conditions are satisfied:
 
 <ul>
        <li>All file paths contained in the database layout are paths relative
        to the main directory.</li>
        <li>No path points to a file residing outside the main directory, that
        is, no file is located outside the main directory.
        (Via the ".." path element a path relative to the main directory
        can point to a file outside of the main directory.
        Applying the ".." path element is perfectly okay as long as the
        path points to a file inside the main directory.)</li>
 </ul>

 take place while this method is running.
 It is therefore safe to invoke this method anytime during a session.</div>
