   <h2>Overview</h2>
   ACDP is an approach and a Java&reg; framework for designing, operating and
   maintaining a database as part of a software that requires access to
   persistent storage of object data.
   <p>
   This page describes some key characteristics of ACDP and a few features of
   the implementation of ACDP in Java.
   </p>
   <p>
   ACDP is the result of many years of ambivalent experience with SQL and
   relational database systems from different vendors in connection with the
   persistent storage of complex data structures.
   This is why this page ends with a few points of criticism regarding the use
   of common database management systems.

   <h2>Main Characteristics</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
      ACDP and the programs that access persistent data are written in the
      same programming language and preferably run in the same process.
      </li>
      <li>
      Navigational: Data can be efficiently accessed via references following
      the directed edges of an object graph.
      </li>
      <li>
      Built-in data types
      <ul>
         <li>
         include the array type
         </li>
         <li>
         match the data types of the programming language
         </li>
         <li>
         can be extended with customized data types
         </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      Thanks to strongly typed tables, columns and values, robust persistence
      layers of multi-tier applications and services can be programmed
      relatively easily.
      </li>
      <li>
      No SQL: Queries are programmed.
      </li>
      <li>
      Currently, ACDP is only implemented in Java.
      See the feature list of Java ACDP <a href="#section3">below</a>.

   </ul>

<section id="section2">
   <h2>More Characteristics</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
      Writing program code for a data model described with a UML class diagram
      is straightforward.
      </li>
      <li>
      By bringing persistent data as close as possible to the programs that
      access them, ACDP facilitates the implementation of a service-oriented
      architecture in which data is read in a domain-specific context and
      exclusively changed in compliance with domain-specific constraints.
      This is in contrast to a dedicated DB server that accepts and processes
      SQL statements out of a domain-specific context.
      </li>
      <li>
      Tables are <em>sequences</em> of rows and a row contains a
      <em>sequence</em> of values.
      If the same read-only query is executed twice, an iteration of the
      result returns the records in the same order.
      </li>
      <li>
      Transactions are never executed concurrently, but one after the other.
      This is a necessary requirement for nested transactions to work as one
      would naturally expect.
      Furthermore, clients do not have to expect that ACDP will unexpectedly
      trigger a rollback, as is the case with conventional DBM systems if, for
      example, a deadlock has to be prevented due to the concurrent execution of
      transactions.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Features of Java ACDP</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
      A database can be stored in the form of a single, highly compressed file
      and, as a read-only database, can be operated with excellent performance
      in main memory.
      </li>
      <li>
      Encryption can be enabled providing a customized cipher.
      </li>
      <li>
      Supports Java's streams API so that queries can be formulated in a
      functional style.
      </li>
      <li>
      Relies on Java's NIO package and thus on the performance of the file
      system of the underlying operating system.
      </li>
      <li>
      Does not use third-party Java libraries or program files (such as
      database drivers).
      There is no magical class enhancement, no leaky abstraction layer, no
      tricks, no excuses.
      </li>
      <li>
      Java ACDP is free of charge, open source, and licensed under the
      permissive <q>Lida License</q>.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Shortcomings with Database Management Systems</h2>
   A (relational) database management system, (R)DBMS, is often used as a
   back-end for managing the persistent storage of complex data structures.
   However, such an approach has the following shortcomings:
   <ul>
      <li>
      DBMS and client often run in separate processes, so that the processes
      have to communicate with each other for each data exchange.
      If, in addition, DBMS and client run on dedicated servers, the servers
      must communicate with each other for each data exchange.
      All of this comes at a price and definitely does not reduce the
      error-proneness of the overall system.
      </li>
      <li>
      Operating a dedicated DB server tempts you to access the persistent data
      in an uncontrolled manner and to change data outside of a domain-specific
      context.
      </li>
      <li>
      Data types provided by the DBMS must be matched to data types provided by
      the programming language in which clients are written.
      Furthermore, the relational database model has no native array type.
      </li>
      <li>
      The relational database model is ideal when it comes to executing
      arbitrary <em>ad hoc</em> queries.
      However, in the realm of objects data access does not naturally take place
      ad-hoc, but follows the directed edges of an object graph.
      The most effective way to implement a link from one object to another is
      to store a <em>reference</em>, just like objects are referenced in main
      memory.
      In the relational database model, however, the reference type is not
      intended.
      </li>
      <li>
      In the relational database model a relation consists of a <em>set</em> of
      tuples.
      The order in which the tuples of a relation are returned in the result of
      a query as well as the order, in which the values of a tuple are returned,
      is therefore not defined.
      If the same read-only query is executed twice, an iteration of the
      result may return the records in different orders.
      </li>
      <li>
      Object-relational mappers, so called ORMs, are to abstract from the
      relational database model.
      The popularity of ORMs shows that the use of RDBMs is not ideal.
      However, ORMs themselves are a target of criticism, as can be seen on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping#Comparison_with_traditional_data_access_techniques">Wikipedia</a>:
      
      <blockquote>
         Disadvantages of ORM tools generally stem from the high level of
         abstraction obscuring what is actually happening in the implementation
         code.
         Also, heavy reliance on ORM software has been cited as a major factor
         in producing poorly designed databases.
      </blockquote>
      
      Practice has shown me that an ORM in non-trivial scenarios really slows
      down the underlying RDBMS even after numerous manual adjustments.
