   <h2>Creation</h2>
   In Chapter <q><a href="design.html">Design</a></q> we coded the classes
   for a sample database.
   Once the classes have been coded, creating the actual database is just a
   matter of running a single method of the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.html" target="_blank">Setup Tool</a>.
   But before that, a few preparatory work needs to be done.

	<h2>Preparing the Classes</h2>
   For the setup tool to run successfully, the database class and the table
   classes must meet a few requirements.
   It is worth noting that these requirements only need to be met during the
   one-time process of creating the database, which means that all changes made
   for this purpose can be undone afterwards.
   Such changes are highlighted below.
   
   <section id="section1.1">
      <h3>Preparing the Database Class</h3>
	   The following things must be done:
	   <ul>
	      <li>
         The class declaration must be annotated with the
         <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.SetupDatabase.html" target="_blank">
         <code>@SetupDatabase</code></a> annotation.
         </li>
         <li>
         All table declarations must be annotated with the
         <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.SetupTableDeclaration.html"
         target="_blank"><code>@SetupTableDeclaration</code></a> annotation.
	      </li>
	   </ul>
      Here is the annotated sample database class from Chapter <q><a
      href="design.html">Design</a></q>:
      <pre>
   <mark>@SetupDatabase(</mark>
      <mark>name = "Edu",</mark>
      <mark>tables = { "Course", "Student", "Teacher", "Contact" }</mark>
   <mark>)</mark>
   final class EduDB extends CustomDatabase {
      <mark>@SetupTableDeclaration("Course")</mark>
      static final CourseTable COURSE_TABLE = new CourseTable();
      <mark>@SetupTableDeclaration("Student")</mark>
      static final StudentTable STUDENT_TABLE = new StudentTable();
      <mark>@SetupTableDeclaration("Teacher")</mark>
      static final TeacherTable TEACHER_TABLE = new TeacherTable();
      <mark>@SetupTableDeclaration("Contact")</mark>
      static final ContactTable CONTACT_TABLE = new ContactTable();
   
      EduDB(Path mainFile, int opMode, boolean writeProtect,
                                                      int consistencyNumber) {
         open(mainFile, opMode, writeProtect, null, consistencyNumber,
                   COURSE_TABLE, STUDENT_TABLE, TEACHER_TABLE, CONTACT_TABLE);
      }
   }</pre>
      Remarks:
      <ol>
         <li>
         The name of the database is specified as the value of the
         <code>name</code> element of the <code>@SetupDatabase</code>
         annotation.
         Besides the required <code>name</code> and <code>tables</code>
         elements, the <code>@SetupDatabase</code> annotation has an optional
         <code>version</code> element which we haven't used in this example.
         </li>
         <li>
         The name of a table is specified with the
         <code>@SetupTableDeclaration</code> annotation.
         The table names are repeated in the <code>tables</code> element of
         the <code>@SetupDatabase</code> annotation.
         </li>
         <li>
         The order of the table names listed in the <code>tables</code> element
         of the <code>@SetupDatabase</code> annotation must be the same as the
         order in which the corresponding table variables appear in the
         <code>open</code> method.
         (The <code>open</code> method is invoked in the constructor.)
         </li>
      </ol>
   </section> 
   
   <section id="section1.2">
      <h3>Preparing the Table Classes</h3>
      The following things must be done:
      <ul>
         <li>
         The class declaration must include the <code>public</code> access level
         modifier and be annotated with the
         <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.SetupTable.html" target="_blank">
         <code>@SetupTable</code></a> annotation.
         </li>
         <li>
         Each column declaration must include the <code>public</code> access
         level modifier and must be annotated with the
         <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.SetupTable.html" target="_blank">
         <code>@SetupColumn</code></a> annotation.
         </li>
         <li>
         The table class must have a <code>public</code> no-arg constructor.
         </li>
      </ul>
      As an example, here the annotated Student table class from Chapter <q><a
      href="design.html">Design</a></q>:
      <pre>
   <mark>@SetupTable({ "Student Number", "Name", "Contact", "Courses" })</mark>
   <mark>public</mark> final class StudentTable extends CustomTable {
      <mark>@SetupColumn("Student Number")</mark>
      <mark>public</mark> static final Column&lt;Integer&gt; STUDENT_NUMBER = CL.ofInteger(NO_NULL);
      <mark>@SetupColumn("Name")</mark>
      <mark>public</mark> static final Column&lt;String&gt; NAME = CL.ofString(NO_NULL, SMALL);
      <mark>@SetupColumn(value = "Contact", refdTable = "Contact")</mark>
      <mark>public</mark> static final Column&lt;Ref&gt; CONTACT = CL.ofRef();
      <mark>@SetupColumn(value = "Courses", refdTable = "Course")</mark>
      <mark>public</mark> static final Column&lt;Ref[]&gt; COURSES = CL.ofArrayOfRef(30);
      
      <mark>public</mark> StudentTable<mark>()</mark> {
         initialize(STUDENT_NUMBER, NAME, CONTACT, COURSES);
      }
   }</pre>
      Remarks:
      <ol>
         <li>
         The name of a column is specified with the <code>@SetupColumn</code>
         annotation.
         The column names are repeated in the <code>@SetupTable</code>
         annotation.
         </li>
         <li>
         The order of the column names listed in the <code>@SetupTable</code>
         annotation must be the same as the order in which the corresponding
         column variables appear in the <code>initialize</code> method.
         (The <code>initialize</code> method is invoked in the constructor.)
         </li>
         <li>
         The name of the referenced table of a column with a reference type is
         specified by the <code>refdTable</code> element of the
         <code>@SetupColumn</code> annotation.
         Recall that the name of a table is specified as the value of the
         <code>@SetupTableDeclaration</code> annotation used in the database
         class.
         </li>
      </ol>

   <h2>Creating the Database</h2>
   Invoking <code>Setup.run(String, Path)</code> creates the database.
   The first parameter specifies the qualified name of the database class and
   the second the directory where to save the generated database files.
   (The database class is the class annotated with the
   <code>@SetupDatabase</code> annotation.)
   <p>
   For example, we create our sample database and save it to the <q>dbDir</q>
   directory by executing
   </p>
   <pre>
   <code>Setup.run("example.db.EduDB", Paths.get("dbDir"));</code></pre>
   If nothing goes wrong a message similar to
   <pre>
   <samp>INFO: Database "Edu" successfully created and saved to "dbDir".</samp></pre>
   is printed to the standard output stream.
   <p>
   Among the files created in the <q>dbDir</q> directory you'll find a file
   with the name <q>layout</q>.
   The layout file is the main database file of a WR database and contains all
   information needed to run the database.
   (The WR database type is explained in the next section.)
   You can <a href="layout1.html" target="_blank">open the layout file</a> with
   any text viewer and read it.
   The entries are formatted as described in the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/misc/Layout.html" target="_blank">
   <code>Layout</code></a> class.
   Do you recognize the name of the database, the names of its tables and the
   names of the tables' columns we just specified in the previous section?
   Section <q><a href="maintenance.html#section1">Changing Settings</a></q> of
   Chapter <q><a href="maintenance.html">Maintenance</a></q> shows you how to
   safely change the entries in the layout file.
   </p>
   <strong>Note</strong>: Never change the layout file manually, unless you are
   a real ACDP expert!
</section>

<section id="section3">
   <h2>Creating an RO Database from a WR Database and vice versa</h2>
   When we speak of an ACDP database we usually mean the writable <q>WR</q>
   type.
   However, there is a second database type, the <q>RO</q> type.
   An RO database is readonly and resides in a highly compacted single file.
   As will be shown in Chapter <q><a href="opening.html">Opening</a></q>, an RO
   database can be loaded completely into main memory, provided that enough main
   memory is available.
   An application whose data is completely in main memory usually scales
   better with respect to the number of concurrent read operations compared
   to an application that has to read data on demand from a secondary memory
   device.
   <p>
   An RO database stored in a file specified by the first argument of the
   following method can be created from an <em>open</em> WR database by
   invoking the
   </p>
   <pre>
   <code>createRO(Path, ICipherFactory)</code></pre>
   method from either an instance of a custom database class (a custom database
   class inherits this method from the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/design/CustomDatabase.html" target="_blank">
   <code>CustomDatabase</code></a> class) or of an instance
   implementing the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Database.html" target="_blank">
   <code>Database</code></a> interface, depending on whether the database was
   opened as a strongly or weakly typed database, respectively.
   (In Chapter <q><a href="opening.html">Opening</a></q> you learn how to open
   a database as a strongly typed or a weakly typed database.)
   <p>
   Specifying a non-null value for the <code>ICipherFactory</code> parameter
   results in an encrypted RO database.
   </p>
   The reverse process is also possible: Invoking the
   </p>
   <pre>
   <code>ROToWR.run(Path, Path, Path, ICipherFactory)</code></pre>
   method of the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/ROToWR.html" target="_blank">
   ROToWR Tool</a> creates a WR database from an RO database.
   Here, the first, second and third parameter are paths that point to the
   RO database, the directory of the WR database to be created and the optional
   layout file of the WR database the RO database was created from,
   respectively.
   The cipher factory is used for reading the RO database as well as for writing
   the WR database.
   <p>
   Of course, converting to an RO database with a cipher factory that generates
   an encryption different from that of the WR database and converting back to
   a WR database results in a copy of the original WR database, but applying a
   different encryption.
