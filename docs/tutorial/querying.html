   <h2>Querying</h2>
   There is neither a query language nor a data definition language in ACDP.
   Simply put: ACDP's SQL is Java.
   This chapter shows you how to formulate and execute queries and how to
   change data in the database, inside or outside a database transaction.
   <p>
   Structural changes to the database are not an issue in this chapter.
   Structural changes include removing a table from the database or inserting a
   new column into an existing table.
   How to structurally change the database is shown in Section
   <q><a href="maintenance.html#section3">Refactoring</a></q> of Chapter
   <q><a href="maintenance.html">Maintenance</a></q>.

   <h2>Populating the Database</h2>
   To populate the sample database just invoke the <code>run</code> method of
   the  <a href="sources.html#Populator"><code>Populator</code></a> class.
 </section>

<section id="section2">
   <h2>Which of <code>EduPL</code>, <code>EduDB</code>, and
       <code>Database</code> to use?</h2>
   How data stored in the database is accessed, depends on how the database is
   opened.
   If the database is opened by creating an instance of the <a
   href="sources.html#EduPL"><code>EduPL</code></a> class, then this instance
   is used for reading data from and writing data to the database.
   If, on the other hand, the database is
   <a href="opening.html">opened directly</a>, the central class to communicate
   with the database is either the domain-specific
   <a href="sources.html#EduDB"><code>EduDB</code></a> class or the
   non-domain-specific <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Database.html" target="_blank">
   <code>Database</code></a> interface, depending on whether the database is
   opened as a strongly typed or weakly typed database.
   
   <pre><code>   Path path = Paths.get("dbDir/layout");
   
   // Open database by creating EduPL instance.
   try (EduPL pl = new EduPL(path, -1, false, 0)) {
      // do something with pl
   }
   
   // Open database as strongly typed database.
   try (EduDB db = new EduDB(path, -1, false, 0)) {
      // do something with db
   }
   
   // Open database as weakly typed database.
   try (Database db = Database.open(path, -1, false, null)) {
      // do something with db
   }</code></pre>
   
   Whenever possible, use the persistence layer, as it is the easiest and safest
   to use.
   This applies in particular if data is to be inserted, updated or deleted.
   However, the persistence layer abstracts from the underlying database tables
   and table rows.
   So, whenever there is a need for a direct access to the tables and rows, the
   database should be openend as a strongly typed database.
   <p>
   The database should only be opened as a weakly typed database if the use
   case can neither be implemented with the persistence layer nor by opening
   the database as a strongly typed database or if the use case is not
   domain-specific.
   (For example, a non-domain-specific use case is <q>get the names of the
   tables of the database</q>.)
   </p>
   To show the difference, let us write some code to display the name and email
   address of the student with number 74.
   (The name and email address of the student with number 74 is equal to
   <q>Nigel Lee</q> and <q>nigel@example.com</q>, respectively).
   We do not repeat the process of opening the database.
   
   <h3><code>EduPL</code></h3>
   <pre><code>   // pl instance of EduPL
   Student student = pl.getStudent(74);
   System.out.println(student.getName() + "  " +
                      student.getContact().getEmail());</code></pre>
                      
   + Compact<br>
   + Foolproof<br>
   + Built-in index can be used
   
   <h3><code>EduDB</code></h3>
   <pre><code>   // EduDB is open
   Row row = STUDENT_TABLE.get(
                         STUDENT_TABLE.indexGet(74),
                                     NAME, CONTACT);
   String email = CONTACT_TABLE.getValue(
                           row.get(CONTACT), EMAIL);
   System.out.println(row.get(NAME) + "  " + email);</code></pre>
   
   (We use static imports to avoid qualifying constants, for example
   <code>STUDENT_TABLE</code> instead of <code>EudDB.STUDENT_TABLE</code> or
   <code>CONTACT</code> instead of <code>StudentTable.CONTACT</code>.)
   <p>
   - Less convenient<br>
   - No enforcement of domain-specific constraints implemented in the
   persistence layer (not a problem in this example)<br>
   + Built-in index can be used<br>
   + Easy and strongly typed access to tables and columns
   </p>
   
   <h3><code>Database</code></h3>
   <pre><code>   // db instance of Database
   Table studentTable = db.getTable("Student");
   Column&lt;?&gt; studentNumberColumn = studentTable.
                                   getColumn("Student Number");
   Column&lt;?&gt; nameColumn = studentTable.getColumn("Name");
   Column&lt;?&gt; contactColumn = studentTable.getColumn("Contact");
			
   Table contactTable = db.getTable("Contact");
   Column&lt;?&gt; emailColumn = contactTable.getColumn("Email");
			
   Row studentRow = studentTable.rows(studentNumberColumn,
                                     nameColumn, contactColumn).
        filter(row -> (int) row.get(studentNumberColumn) == 74).
        findAny().get();
			
   Row contactRow = contactTable.get((Ref) studentRow.get(
                                  contactColumn), emailColumn);
   System.out.println(studentRow.get(nameColumn) + "  " +
                                  contactRow.get(emailColumn));</code></pre>
                                  
   - Verbose<br>
   - Cumbersome and error-prone access to tables and columns<br>
   - Must iterate Student table

   <h2>Ad-hoc Queries</h2>
   When it comes to formulating a query <q>on the fly</q>, ACDP cannot compete
   with SQL.
   This is not surprising, because SQL is an interpreted, declarative language
   developed with a focus on the spontaneous formulation of database queries,
   while Java is a compilable, general-purpose programming language.
   However, even if ad-hoc queries in ACDP are not quite as ad-hoc as in SQL:
   For a Java programmer who is practiced in querying data structures of a
   certain complexity, they do not pose a major challenge.
   And the nice thing is that no knowledge beyond Java is required to program
   database queries in ACDP <em>and</em> to process their results.
   <p>
   In the following, we define a query on our sample database to be an
   <em>ad-hoc query</em> if it cannot be done with the persistence layer.
   Therefore, we open the sample database as a strongly typed <code>EduDB</code>
   database as was shown in the previous section.
   </p>
   <section id="section3.1">
   <h3>Visiting the Rows of a Table</h3>
   It is possible to iterate over the rows of a table.
   Good to know that the order in which the rows of an unchanged table are
   returned by any of the iterators is always the same.
   In addition, ACDP supports the streams API of Java 8.
   <p>
   For example, to display the names of all courses can be done in the
   following three ways.
   (The process of opening the database and the declaration of some necessary
   static imports are omitted.)
   </p>
   1. Applying a for-each loop
   
   <pre><code>   for (Row row : COURSE_TABLE) {
      System.out.println(row.get(NAME));
   }</code></pre>
   
   2. Getting an instance of <code>Iterator&lt;Row&gt;</code>
   
   <pre><code>   for (Iterator&lt;Row&gt; it = COURSE_TABLE.iterator(NAME);
                                        it.hasNext();) {
      System.out.println(it.next().get(NAME));
   }</code></pre>
   
   3. Using <code>Stream&lt;Row&gt;</code>
   
   <pre><code>   COURSE_TABLE.rows(NAME).forEach(row ->
                     System.out.println(row.get(NAME)));</code></pre>
                     
   Note that the <code>Row</code> instances returned in the for-each loop of the
   first variant contain all column values, including the values for the ID and
   Teacher column of the Course table.
   In the second and third variant the row instances only contain the values of
   the Name column.
   </section>
   
   <section id="section3.2">
   <h3>More Queries</h3>
   &bull; Create a list of names of all students enrolled in the C# programming
   course:
   
   <pre><code>   List&lt;String&gt; result = STUDENT_TABLE.rows(NAME, COURSES).
          filter(r -> Arrays.stream(r.get(COURSES)).
               filter(ref -> COURSE_TABLE.getValue(ref,
                     CourseTable.ID).equals("CSHARP")).
                     findAny().isPresent()).
          map(r -> r.get(NAME)).collect(toList());</code></pre>
          
   &bull; Create a map with keys being the names of the teachers and values
   being the names of the students attending at least one of the courses
   instructed by the teacher:
   
   <pre><code>   Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
   for (Row tRow : TEACHER_TABLE) {
      List&lt;Ref&gt; l1 = Arrays.asList(tRow.get(
                              TeacherTable.COURSES));
      List&lt;String&gt; sList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
      for (Row sRow : STUDENT_TABLE) {
         List&lt;Ref&gt; l2 = Arrays.asList(sRow.get(
                              StudentTable.COURSES));
         if (l1.stream().filter(l2::contains).
                             findAny().isPresent()) {
            sList.add(sRow.get(StudentTable.NAME));
         }
      }
      result.put(tRow.get(TeacherTable.NAME), sList);
   }</code></pre>
   
   Of course, many more queries are conceivable.

   <h2>Data Changes</h2>
   To ensure that no domain-specific constraints are violated, data changes
   should only be made using the persistence layer.
   For example, deleting teacher "Jane Smith" by calling
   
   <pre><code>   // pl instance of EduPL
   pl.deleteTeacher("Jane Smith");</code></pre>
   
   not only causes the data of <q>Jane Smith</q> to be removed from the Teacher
   table, but also removes her contact details from the Contact table.
   Furthermore, the values in the Teacher column of the Course table are
   overwritten with the <code>null</code> value for the courses that "Jane
   Smith" has instructed.
   <p>
   Here is how to change the email address of student 74 to
   <q>n.lee@example.com</q> and add the course <q>LSSGBP</q> to his list of
   courses:
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   Student student = pl.getStudent(74);
   Contact contact = student.getContact();
   List&lt;String&gt; courses = student.getCourses();
   
   contact.setEmail("n.lee@example.com");
   courses.add("LSSGBP");
         
   pl.persistStudent(74, student.getName(), contact, courses);</code></pre>
   
   Sometimes, however, changes to the data need to be made ad-hoc.
   Let us assume, for example, that the system for assigning postal codes has
   been changed: All postal codes starting with 8 are to start with 80.
   So the postal code 84672 should now be 804672.
   The persistence layer doesn't provide direct access to the contact details.
   Hence, we open the database as a strongly typed <code>EduDB</code> database
   and call
   
   <pre><code>   EduDB.CONTACT_TABLE.updateAllChangeValues(
           ContactTable.POSTAL_CODE,
           pc -> pc / 10000 == 8 ? 800000 + pc % 80000 : pc);</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="section5">
   <h2>Transactions, Units, Read Zones</h2>
   So far, all database operations were executed outside a transaction.
   We tacitly assumed that
   
   <ol>
      <li>A possible destruction of the database's integrity is accepted.
      (This may be due to a write operation that catastrophically fails.)</li>
      <li>A possible violation of domain-specific constraints is accepted.
      (This may be because a sequence of write operations could not be
      completed due to an unexpected exceptional situation.)</li>
      <li>No other clients use the database at the same time.</li>
   </ol>
   
   To execute a database operation within a transaction it must be executed
   either within a <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Unit.html" target="_blank">unit</a>
   or a <a href="../javadoc/acdp/ReadZone.html" target="_blank">read zone</a>.
   Database operations in a read zone must be read-only.
   <p>
   For example, using a unit, the code snippet
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   // pl instance of EduPL
   try (Unit u = pl.openUnit()) {
      pl.deleteCourse("CFR");
      <mark>u.commit();</mark>
   }</code></pre>
   
   removes the <q>CFR</q> course from the database.
   (The <q>CFR</q> course can be deleted without provoking a <a
   href="../javadoc/acdp/exceptions/DeleteConstraintException.html"
   target="_blank"><code>DeleteConstraintException</code></a> because it is
   neither referenced by a student nor a teacher.)
   If <code>u.commit()</code> had been missing, the deletion process would have
   been undone when the unit was closed.
   For example, the following code does not remove the other non-referenced
   courses from the database, because <code>u.commit()</code> is missing:
   
   <pre><code>   // Don't forget u.commit() after the last write operation.
   try (Unit u = pl.openUnit()) {
      pl.deleteCourse("CDPC");
      pl.deleteCourse("HDJ");
      pl.deleteCourse("MBS");
   }</code></pre>
   
   And
   
   <pre><code>   // Don't forget u.commit() after the last write operation.
   try (Unit u = pl.openUnit()) {
      pl.deleteCourse("CDPC");
      pl.deleteCourse("HDJ");
      <mark>u.commit();</mark>
      pl.deleteCourse("MBS");
   }</code></pre>
   
   just removes the <q>CDPC</q> and <q>HDJ</q> courses but not the
   <q>MBS</q> course from the database.
   <p>
   The integrity of the database is maintained even if a call to
   <code>u.commit()</code> is missing.
   However, one must be aware that if database changes are rolled back, other
   things can get into disarray: In the example above, the <em>index</em> of the
   Course table will miss the entry for the <q>MBS</q> course, although that
   course still resides in the database.
   This is because the removal of the <q>MBS</q> course from the index has not
   been undone.
   </p>
   <p>
   <em>It is a good idea to treat any rollback situation as a bug.</em>
   </p>
   <p>
   Two database write operations that are started in two different threads are
   never executed concurrently, regardless of whether they run inside or outside
   a unit.
   Write operations are therefore synchronized.
   On the other hand, read operations are not synchronized.
   They can fail if a write operation is currently running in a different
   thread.
   To synchronize read operations, use a read zone.
   Read operations within a read zone are never executed concurrently with
   a write operation, but they are executed concurrently with read operations
   inside open read zones in different threads.
   </p>
   <p>
   In Section <q><a href="#section3.1">Visiting the Rows of a Table</a></q>
   from above we displayed the name of all courses in the Course table.
   Let's do the same thing but this time inside a read zone:
   
   <pre><code>   try (ReadZone rz = db.openReadZone()) {
      COURSE_TABLE.rows(NAME).forEach(row ->
                     System.out.println(row.get(NAME)));
   }</code></pre>
   
   We could execute this operation within a unit, which would, however, have the
   consequence that all program instructions within read zones in other threads
   would be blocked until this operation was completed.
   </p>
   Learn more about how transactions are implemented in ACDP by reading the
   sections <q>Units</q>, <q>Read Zones</q>, and <q>Durability</q> in the
   Javadoc description of the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Database.html"
