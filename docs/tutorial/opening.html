   <h2>Opening</h2>
   A database must be opened before it can be used and it must be closed when
   it is no longer used.
   <p>
   Creating a database by invoking the constructor of a class that extends the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/design/CustomDatabase.html" target="_blank">
   <code>CustomDatabase</code></a> class opens the database as a <em>strongly
   typed</em> database whereas creating an instance of the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Database.html" target="_blank"><code>Database</code></a>
   interface by invoking the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Database.html#open(java.nio.file.Path,int,boolean)"
   target="_blank"><code>Database.open</code></a> method opens the database as
   a <em>weakly typed</em> database.
   For example, suppose our sample database which we created in Section
   <q><a href="creation.html#section2">Creating the Database</a></q> of Chapter
   <q><a href="creation.html">Creation</a></q> is still saved in the
   <q>dbDir</q> directory.
   Then, with
   </p>
   <pre><code>   Path path = Paths.get("dbDir/layout");</code></pre>
   
   and applying the <code>try-with-resources</code> statement
   
   <pre><code>   try (EduDB db = new EduDB(path, -1, false, 0)) {
      // do something with db
   }</code></pre>
   
   opens and closes the sample database as a <em>strongly typed</em> database,
   whereas
   
   <pre><code>   try (Database db = Database.open(path, -1, false, null)) {
      // do something with db
   }</code></pre>
   
   opens and closes the same database as a <em>weakly typed</em> database.
   (The parameters of the methods are explained in Section <q><a
   href="#section2">Parameters</a></q>.)

   <h2>Strongly and Weakly Typed</h2>
   Database queries make references to tables and columns and the result is
   typically a collection of values, each value being of a particular data
   type.
   <p>
   A strongly typed database has well-defined fields that refer to instances
   of strongly typed tables which in turn refer to instances of strongly
   typed columns.
   For example, in Chapter <q><a href="design.html">Design</a></q> we defined
   the field <code>TEACHER_TABLE</code> in the <code>EduDB</code> class and
   the field <code>POSTAL_CODE</code> in the <code>ContactTable</code> class.
   So
   </p>
   <pre>
   <code>TeacherTable t = EduDB.TEACHER_TABLE;</code>
   <code>Column&lt;Integer&gt; c = ContactTable.POSTAL_CODE;</code></pre>
   
   are valid assignments.
   Note that the value of a postal code is an instance of the
   <code>Integer</code> class.
   Any typos or wrong assumptions about the type of a column's value are
   reported at compile-time.
   (Try it by replacing <code>Integer</code> with a different type.)
   Moreover, the program code is completely independent of the table and column
   names so that these can be changed later without affecting client code.
   Changing the type of a column is no problem either because the compiler
   signals this change to the programmer by reporting a compilation error each
   time this column or a value of this column is used in the program code.
   <p>
   Unfortunately, we can't use these strongly typed fields if we open the
   database as a weakly typed database.
   In a weakly typed database, tables and columns are referenced by name and a
   value must often be cast to its assumed <q>real</q> type.
   For example, assume that the sample database was opened as a weakly typed
   database.
   Best we can do for assigning the Teacher table and the Postal Code column
   is:
   </p>
   <pre>
   <code>Table t = db.getTable("Teacher")</code>;
   <code>Column&lt;?&gt; c = db.getTable("Contact").getColumn("PostalCode")</code>;</pre>
   
   These methods do not return instances of the strong types
   <code>TeacherTable</code> and <code>Column&lt;Integer&gt;</code> but of the
   weak types
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Table.html" target="_blank"><code>Table</code></a> and
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Column.html" target="_blank">
   <code>Column&lt;?&gt;</code></a>, respectively.
   Note how the <q>real</q> type of a postal code is left open.
   You won't see any errors at compile-time if you misspelled the name of a
   table or column or if you did cast a postal code to a wrong type.
   Only at runtime will you notice sooner or later that your code does not
   behave as you expect.
   Even worse, the program code depends on table and column names, so any change
   in the name of a referenced table or column will silently break your code.
   The same applies if you change the type of a column and somewhere in your
   code lurks a cast of a value of that column to its <q>real</q> type.
   <p>
   Another point concerns the limitation to meet constraints resulting from the
   domain-specific data model.
   For example, the insertion of an arbitrary integer into the Postal Code
   column of the Contact table should be avoided, because not every arbitrary
   integer represents a postal code.
   Another example is the handling of contacts:
   As the <a href="design.html#uml">UML diagram</a> suggests, contacts should
   only be inserted into and removed from the Contact table in connection with
   students and teachers.
   </p>
   <p>
   Such domain-specific constraints can be programmed in the custom database
   class and the custom table classes or outside of these classes, but using
   these classes.
   On the other hand, it is not possible to enforce domain-specific constraints
   if the database is opened as a weakly typed database.
   </p>
   <p>
   After all, the reader might wonder why ACDP allows a database to be opened as
   a weakly typed database.
   The reason is that there are use cases that require reading and manipulating
   the data stored in a database in a general context that is not specific to
   its domain.
   One such use case is, for example, an application that outputs the content
   of <em>any</em> table in a human-readable manner.
   </p>
   Opening a database as a weakly typed database can be done from the
   information saved in the database layout only.
   (The database layout of a WR database is stored in the layout file whereas
   the database layout of an RO database is contained in the one and only one
   RO database file.)
   Therefore, ACDP does not need to know of a custom database class or of any
   custom table classes in order to open a database as a weakly typed database.

<section id="section2">
   <h2>Parameters</h2>
   The signatures of the methods for opening a database as a strongly typed
   database and a weakly typed database are
   
   <pre>
   <code>CustomDatabase.open(Path mainFile, int opMode, boolean writeProtect,
                  ICipherFactory cipherFactory, int consistencyNumber,
                                           CustomTable... customTables)</code></pre>
   and
   
   <pre>
   <code>Database.open(Path mainFile, int opMode, boolean writeProtect,
                                    ICipherFactory cipherFactory)</code></pre>
   respectively.
   The set of parameters of the latter method is a subset of the set of
   parameters of the first method.
   The semantic of each parameter is:
   
   <dl>
      <dt><code>mainFile</code></dt>
      <dd>The path&mdash;including the file name&mdash;of the main database
      file.
      The main database file of a WR database is the layout file whereas the
      main database file of an RO database is the one and only RO database
      file.</dd>
      <dt><code>opMode</code></dt>
      <dd>The mode of operation: -3 (RO only), -2 (RO only), -1, 0, &gt; 0.<br>
      If the value is equal to zero then the backing table files (only one file
      if the database is an RO database) are immediately closed as soon as they
      become idle.
      If the value is positive and equal to <code>n</code> then the backing
      table files are closed <code>max(10, n)</code> milliseconds after they
      become idle or when the database is closed.
      If the value is equal to -1 then the backing table files once opened
      remain open until the database is closed.
      If the value is equal to -2 then the <em>zipped</em> and
      <em>encrypted</em> (if encryption is turned on) content of an RO database
      is completely mapped into memory.
      If the value is equal to -3 then the <em>unzipped</em> and
      <em>decrypted</em> (if encryption is turned on) content of an RO database
      is completely mapped into memory.<br>
      A value equal to zero is recommended only if the database is a WR database
      and the operating system can't sustain a bunch of files all being opened
      at the same time.
      In a server environment, a positive value is recommended or, provided
      that the database is an RO database and there is enough memory available,
      a value equal to -2 (less memory required, slower) or -3 (more memory
      required, faster).</dd>
      <dt><code>writeProtect</code></dt>
      <dd>Protects a WR database from being modified.
      If set to <code>true</code> then no data of the database can be inserted,
      deleted or updated.
      This parameter has no effect if the database is an RO database.</dd>
      <dt><code>cipherFactory</code></dt>
      <dd>The cipher factory or <code>null</code> if no encryption is required.
      See Section <q><a href="design.html#section5">Coding a Cipher
      Factory</a></q> of Chapter <q><a href="design.html">Design</a></q>
      for an example of a cipher factory.</dd>
      <dt><code>consistencyNumber</code></dt>
      <dd>The consistency number.
      The consistency number is stored in the database layout.
      If the value of this parameter does not match the stored value then
      opening the database fails.
      The purpose of this parameter is to link a specific version of the
      domain-specific database logic to a matching version of the data in the
      database.
      The
      <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Setup.html" target="_blank">Setup Tool</a>
      which we learned about in Chapter
      <q><a href="creation.html">Creation</a></q> sets the value of the
      consistency number to zero when it creates the layout file.</dd>
      <dt><code>customTables</code></dt>
      <dd>The list of custom tables.
      The value of this parameter is predefined by the concrete custom database
      class and is not intended to be chosen by the database user.</dd>
