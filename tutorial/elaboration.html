   <h2>Elaboration</h2>
   In Chapter <q><a href="opening.html">Opening</a></q>, we opened and closed
   a database without having done anything useful with it.
   We now could populate the database and carry out some queries right away.
   In this chapter, however, we program some key aspects of a robust persistence
   layer for a multilayered application.
   This requires the programming of a few additions to the database classes.
   <p>
   The persistence layer to be created has the following characteristics:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>It enforces compliance with domain-specific constraints.</li>
      <li>The return values as well as the parameters of the methods being part
      of the user interface are strongly typed.</li>
      <li>The user interface includes domain-specific DAOs (Data Access
      Objects).</li>
   </ul>

   To keep this chapter from getting too large, only a few aspects are
   emphasized, citing the source code where necessary.

<section id="section1">
   <h2>The <code>EduPL</code> Class</h2>
   The persistence layer should cover at least the basic functionality of a
   persistent storage: Insert, Update, Delete and Get.
   For this purpose, we assign a DAO to each of the entities Contact, Course,
   Student, and Teacher and declare the following methods:
   <pre><code>   void persistCourse(String id, String name)
   void persistStudent(int studentNumber, String name,
                         Contact contact, List&lt;String&gt; courses)
   void persistTeacher(String name, BigInteger salary,
                         Contact contact, List&lt;String&gt; courses)
                         
   void deleteCourse(String id)
   void deleteStudent(int studentNumber)
   void deleteTeacher(String name)
   
   Course getCourse(String id)
   Student getStudent(int studentNumber)
   Teacher getTeacher(String name)</code></pre>
   No methods are defined for dealing directyl with contacts, because according
   to the <a href="design.html#uml">UML diagram</a>, the Contact entity is
   entirely managed by the Student and Teacher entities.
   <p>
   We could add these methods to the <a
   href="sources.html#EduDB"><code>EduDB</code></a> database class which we last
   saw in Section
   <q><a href="creation.html#section1.1">Preparing the Database Class</a></q> of
   Chapter <q><a href="creation.html">Creation</a></q>.
   However, we prefer a clear separation between the functionality of the
   database and the functionality of the persistence layer.
   That is why we declare these methods in a new class, the
   <a href="sources.html#EduPL"><code>EduPL</code></a> class, where
   <code>PL</code> is an abbreviation for <q>Persistence Layer</q>.
   </p>
   Remarks:
   <ol>
      <li>It is assumed that the course <code>id</code>, the
      <code>studentNumber</code> and the teacher <code>name</code> act as the
      primary keys for the Course, Student and Teacher entities, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>A <code>persist</code> method works as an insert method if the
      database does not yet contain an entry with the specified value for the
      primary key.
      Otherwise, it works as an update method.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>persistCourse</code> method has no <code>teacher</code>
      parameter: The link from a course to a teacher is controlled by the
      <code>courses</code> parameter of the <code>persistTeacher</code> method.
      </li>
      <li>
      The <a href="sources.html#Contact"><code>Contact</code></a> DAO class just
      collects the details of a contact.
      We included the <code>checkEmail</code> method that checks if an arbitrary
      text is a valid email address.
      It would be a good idea to define such validation methods for the other
      contact-details as well and call them from within the constructor and
      setter methods.
      </li>
      <li>
      Both DAO classes <a href="sources.html#Student"><code>Student</code></a>
      and <a href="sources.html#Teacher"><code>Teacher</code></a> are derived
      from the <a href="sources.html#Person"><code>Person</code></a> class
      because students and teachers have common attributes: Besides a name,
      both have a contact and a list of courses.
      Note that a <code>Person</code> object does not store the contact or
      courses directly, but only <em>links</em> to the contact and courses.
      Technically, a link in ACDP is a <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Ref.html"
      target="_blank">row reference</a>, that is, a reference that directly
      references a specific row in a table.
      The <code>Person</code> class stores the row reference of the contact in
      the <code>contactRef</code> variable and the row references of
      the courses in the <code>courseRefs</code> variable.
      Only when the <code>getContact</code> and the <code>getCourses</code>
      methods are called is the data in the referenced rows loaded from the
      Contact and Course table, respectively.
      The same mechanism is applied for the link to the teacher in the 
      <a href="sources.html#Course"><code>Course</code></a> DAO class.
      Note that all contact details are loaded but only the values for the
      primary keys of the Course and Teacher entities which are the course
      <code>id</code> and the teacher <code>name</code>, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
      <em>ACDP does not allow dangling row references.</em>
      A dangling row reference would arise if it were possible to delete a row
      in a table that is referenced by this or another row.
      ACDP therefore prevents the deletion of a referenced row and throws a <a
      href="../javadoc/acdp/exceptions/DeleteConstraintException.html"
      target="_blank"><code>DeleteConstraintException</code></a> instead.
      Since courses can be referenced by both, students and teachers, it is not
      possible to delete a course from the database as long as at least one
      student or teacher references the course.
      Fine, but what about removing a teacher from the database?
      The UML diagram shows that the entities Course and Teacher can reference
      each other.
      Therefore, without further action no teacher could be removed from the
      database that references a course that in turn references the teacher.
      The solution is to delete the references to this teacher in all courses
      of the Course table <em>before</em> this teacher itself is deleted in
      the Teacher table.
      For details, see the part of the <a href="sources.html#EduPL">
      source code</a> in the <code>deleteTeacher</code> method which is
      commented with <q>Release link from course to teacher</q>.
      (Releasing a link is done by setting the row reference to
      <code>null</code>.)
      </li>
      <li>
      The source code of the student and teacher methods includes the
      persistence management of contacts.
      For example, inserting a student into the Student table includes inserting
      that student's contact details into the Contact table.
      When a contact is updated, it is checked which contact details have
      actually changed compared to the stored contact details and only those
      that have actually changed are updated, see the source code of the
      <code>updateContact</code> method.
      </li>
      <li>
      Contacts do not have an independent identity.
      It is therefore not necessary to define a primary key for contacts.
      In a relational database, an artificial primary key for contacts would
      have to be defined.
      </li>
      <li>
      As we will see in the next section, an <em>index</em> is maintained for
      each of the Course, Student and Teacher tables to quickly determine
      whether a certain course, a certain student or a certain teacher is stored
      in the database and, if so, in which row it is located within the
      respective table.
      The index therefore maps the value for a primary key to a row reference.
      The corresponding <code>indexGet</code> method defined in the <a
      href="sources.html#IdTable"><code>IdTable</code></a> class is invoked in
      almost all public methods of the <code>EduPL</code> class.
      More about indexes and the <code>IdTable</code> class in the following
      sections.
      </li>
   </ol>
   The <a href="sources.html#EduPL"><code>EduPL</code></a> class has two
   additional methods <code>openUnit()</code> and <code>openReadZone()</code>.
   They are related to database transactions and are explained in Chapter <q><a
   href="querying.html">Querying</a></q>.
   <p>
   The rest of this section delves deeper into the source code by taking a
   closer look at the <code>getContact</code> method of the
   <a href="sources.html#Person"><code>Person</code></a> class as an example.
   </p>
   <pre><code>   public final Contact getContact() {
      final Row row = CONTACT_TABLE.get(contactRef);
      return new Contact(row.get(PHONE_NUMBER), row.get(EMAIL), row.get(STREET),
                                       row.get(CITY), row.get(STATE),
                                       row.get(POSTAL_CODE), row.get(COUNTRY));
   }</code></pre>
   The first line of the method's body reads the row referenced by the
   <code>contactRef</code> variable from the Contact table.
   The following lines extract the individual column values from the row and
   create and return a new
   <a href="sources.html#Contact"><code>Contact</code></a> DAO.
   <p>
   The parameters of the constructor of the <code>Contact</code> class are
   strongly typed.
   For example, the <code>postalCode</code> parameter is not simply of type
   <code>Object</code>, but of the primitive type <code>int</code>.
   The interesting thing is that the column value for the postal code does not
   have to be cast to <code>int</code> since <code>row.get(POSTAL_CODE)</code>
   returns an instance of the <code>Integer</code> class which is internally
   converted by Java to an <code>int</code> value.
   In fact, the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Row.html#get(acdp.Column)"
   target="_blank"><code>get(Column)</code></a> method of the <code>Row</code>
   interface is declared as
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>&lt;T&gt; T get(Column&lt;T&gt; column)</code></pre>
      
   Since the <code>POSTAL_CODE</code> column is of type
   <code>Column&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, the type parameter <code>T</code>
   is replaced by the compiler with the type argument <code>Integer</code>.
   <p>
   If the concrete type of the <code>POSTAL_CODE</code> column were to be
   changed later, for example from <code>Integer</code> to
   <code>String</code>, the compiler would immediately detect an error
   wherever this column value was assigned to an <code>int</code> variable.
   Strong typing reduces the error-proneness of program code and makes it
   more robust against future changes.

   <h2>Elaborating the Table Classes</h2>
   We last saw the table classes
   <a href="sources.html#ContactTable"><code>ContactTable</code></a>,
   <a href="sources.html#StudentTable"><code>StudentTable</code></a>,
   <a href="sources.html#CourseTable"><code>CourseTable</code></a>, and
   <a href="sources.html#TeacherTable"><code>TeacherTable</code></a> in Section
   <q><a href="creation.html#section1.2">Preparing the Table Classes</a></q> of
   Chapter <q><a href="creation.html">Creation</a></q>.
   They all were derived from the <a
   href="../javadoc/acdp/design/CustomTable.html"
   target="_blank"><code>CustomTable</code></a> abstract class.
   We do not change these classes anymore with the exception that we place the
   new abstract <a href="sources.html#IdTable"><code>IdTable</code></a> class
   between the <code>CustomTable</code> class and the <code>StudentTable</code>,
   <code>CourseTable</code>, and <code>TeacherTable</code> classes:
   <figure id="tables">
      <img src="tables.svg" alt="UML table classes diagram" width="350"
                                                               height="260" />
   </figure>
   The write operations (insert, update, delete) of the <code>CustomTable</code>
   class are not declared with the <code>final</code> modifier.
   Concrete table classes can overwrite these methods for various purposes,
   for example to restrict their use or to update an index.
   For our sample database, we assume that the domain-specific validity checks
   of values, for example if a certain integer value is actually a valid postal
   code, are already programmed in the DAO classes, so that we don't have to
   worry about this in the table classes.
   <p>
   An ID table, that is technically a subclass of the <code>IdTable</code>
   class, maintains an index of type <code>Map&lt;Object, Ref&gt;</code> that
   maps an object to a row reference.
   The index is used to map a value for the primary key to a row reference, so
   that for a particular value of the primary key the remaining column values
   can be quickly loaded from the table without having to perform a costly
   search within the table.
   The <code>IdTable</code> class assumes that the first column of the ID table
   contains the values for the primary key.
   </p>
   Note that the public audience is able to consult the index of an ID table by
   invoking the <code>IdTable.indexGet</code> method.
   However, directly changing the index is not possible.
   The index is changed each time a student, course or teacher is inserted into
   or deleted from the respective ID table, see the <code>IdTable.insert</code>
   and the <code>IdTable.delete(Object)</code> methods.
   Note that the <code>IdTable.insert</code> method overrides the
   <code>CustomTable.insert</code> method.
   Furthermore, the <code>IdTable.delete(Ref)</code> method overrides the
   <code>CustomTable.delete(Ref)</code> method by throwing an
   <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>.
   It is therefore not possible to insert a row into or to delete a row from an
   ID table without the index being updated.
</section>
   
<section id="section3">
   <h2>More about Indexes</h2>
   <p>
   As seen in the source code of the constructor of the <a
   href="sources.html#EduDB"><code>EduDB</code></a> class, the index for each
   ID table is completely loaded into main memory.
   Creating the indexes as part of opening the database works well because ACDP
   iterates very efficiently over the rows of a table.
   However, keeping the indexes in main memory may not be feasible.
   In such cases, other strategies may be appropriate, for example using
   <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/mvstore.html">MVStore</a> of the
   <a href="https://www.h2database.com/">H2 Database Engine</a>.
   </p>
   Note that indexes are less important in ACDP than in relational databases
   because relational databases do not store row references.
   Instead, the concept of <em>foreign keys</em> is used to connect database
   relations.
   An index supports a <em>join operation</em> to efficiently map a value for a
   foreign key to a tuple.
   Since data is usually navigated along an <em>object graph</em>, there is only
   a need for an index in ACDP if data for a particular object has to be loaded
   from a value for its primary key.
   However, if there is a repeated need to evaluate data outside of the object
   graph, an index may be necessary if other measures, such as transforming the
   data model into another one that allows evaluation along the object graph,
   prove to be unfeasible.
