   <h2>Maintenance</h2>
   You don't need to be a certified database administrator to maintain an ACDP
   database.
   Maintaining an ACDP database involves:
   <ol>
      <li>Making changes to the database settings.</li>
      <li>Compacting the database from time to time.</li>
      <li>Making structural changes to the database.</li>
      <li>Checking and possibly restoring the integrity of the database.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   These tasks are covered in the remaining sections of this page:

   <h2>Changing Settings</h2>
   The <a href="layout1.html" target="_blank">layout</a> bundles all information
   about a database.
   This includes information from very different categories, such as the names
   of tables and columns, descriptors of column types, path information of
   backing data files, dimension sizes, such as the number of bytes for storing
   row references, and other very technical information.
   <p>
   The information contained in the layout can be read invoking the
   <code>info</code> method which is defined on all three levels (database,
   table, column).
   For example, to get the type descriptor of the Courses column of the Teacher
   table call
   </p>
   <pre><code>   try (EduDB db = new EduDB(Paths.get("dbDir/layout"), -1, true, 0)) {
      String desc = TeacherTable.COURSES.info().type().typeDesc());
   }</code></pre>
   (The type descriptor describes the type of a table column.
   It is used to dynamically create the column types at database startup.)
   <p>
   The <code>info</code> method can be used for both a WR and RO database.
   </p>
   <p>
   If the database is a WR database, information from the layout can be read
   even when the database is closed.
   This is done with the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Settings.html"
   target="_blank"><code>Settings</code></a> class.
   For example, to get the type descriptor of the Courses column of the Teacher
   table call
   </p>
   <pre><code>   String desc = new Settings(Paths.get("dbDir/layout")).
                        getTypeDesc("Teacher", "Courses"));</code></pre>
   where <q>Teacher</q> is the name of the teacher table and <q>Courses</q> is
   the name of the Courses column.
   <p>
   Entries in a layout can also be safely changed with the <code>Settings</code>
   class.
   For example, the following code changes the name of the Student table from
   <q>Student</q> to <q>Pupil</q>, the column name <q>Student Number</q> to
   <q>Pupil Number</q> and adds the version number <q>1.0</q> to the database.
   </p>
   <pre><code>   new Settings(Paths.get("dbDir/layout")).
             setTableName("Student", "Pupil").
             setColumnName("Pupil", "Student Number", "Pupil Number").
             setVersion("1.0").save();</code></pre>
   It is important to invoke the <code>save</code> method so that the changes
   are actually saved to the layout file.
   <p>
   Not all entries in the layout can be changed with the <code>Settings</code>
   class.
   For example, the type descriptor of the Courses column of the Teacher table
   cannot be changed with the <code>Settings</code> class, because otherwise the
   database would no longer work.
   (The type descriptor in the layout is automatically adjusted when the type
   of a column is changed using the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Refactor.html"
   target="_blank"><code>Refactor</code></a> class described in Section <q><a
   href="#section3">Refactoring</a></q>.)
   </p>
   <strong>Note</strong>: Never change the layout file manually, unless you are
   a real ACDP expert!

<section id="section2">
   <h2>Compacting</h2>
   ACDP distinguishes between fixed-length (FL) and variable-length (VL) data.
   This means that the representation of values as a sequence of bytes is
   either always the same length, regardless of the value, or has a variable
   length depending on the value.
   For example, the data of an integer value in the Postal Code column of the
   <a href="sources.html#ContactTable">Contact table</a> is always four bytes.
   In contrast, the data of the string values of the Email column have
   different lengths, depending on the string value.
   <p>
   ACDP stores FL and VL data in two separate files.
   </p>
   <p>
   When data is inserted, updated and deleted, unused memory blocks, so-called
   <em>gaps</em>, arise in the data files.
   For example, inserting 100 rows into a newly created table and deleting
   95 results in a FL data file which consists of almost 95% gaps.
   </p>
   <p>
   Gaps in a data file can be eliminated by a process called
   <em>compacting</em>, which reduces the size of the file accordingly.
   </p>
   <p>
   Fortunately, gaps in an FL data file can be filled in by ACDP as new rows
   are inserted into the table.
   So, if you insert 95 rows into the table mentioned above, all gaps in the
   FL data file are eliminated.
   Since unused memory blocks can be reused, compacting an FL data file is only
   necessary in rare cases.
   </p>
   <p>
   Unfortunately, this looks different in case of a VL data file.
   ACDP has very limited ability to fill gaps in VL data files during normal
   operation.
   As VL data is inserted, updated and deleted the number of gaps usually
   increases over time, making it necessary to compact the VL data file of a
   table from time to time.
   </p>
   The data files can be compacted at any time with the database open using the
   methods
   
   <pre><code>   compactFL()  // Compacts the FL data file of a table</code></pre>
   
   and
   
   <pre><code>   compactVL()  // Compacts the VL data file of a table</code></pre>
   
   which are declared in the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/Table.html"
   target="_blank"><code>Table</code></a> interface and in the <a
   href="../javadoc/acdp/design/CustomTable.html"
   target="_blank"><code>CustomTable</code></a> class.
   <p>
   For example, the following program code compacts the VL data file of each
   table in a database if the size of memory occupied by gaps is larger than
   the total size of used memory blocks.
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   // db instance of CustomTable
   // If db is an instance of Database then replace
   // second line of code with
   // for (Table table : db.getTables()) {
   if (db.info().isWritable()) {
      // Since db is writable db is a WR database.
      for (CustomTable table : db.getTables()) {
         final WRStoreInfo info = (WRStoreInfo)
                          table.info().storeInfo();
         if (info.vlUnused() > info.vlUsed()) {
            table.compactVL();
         }
      }
   }</code></pre>
   
   This program code can be executed when the database is opened or closed or,
   if the database is open for a long time, this program code can be executed
   in a separate thread every few minutes or seconds.
   <p>
   The <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/KeyFigures.html"
   target="_blank"><code>KeyFigures</code></a> class prints a report on the most
   important figures of a database, including the size of the unused memory for
   each table.
   </p>
</section>

<section id="section3">
   <h2>Refactoring</h2>
   Refactoring a database means changing the structure of the database, for
   instance, removing a table from the database or modifying the type of a
   column of a certain table.
   Refactoring is usually done at a time when the database is already filled
   with some data.
   The <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Refactor.html"
   target="_blank"><code>Refactor</code></a> class provides methods for
   refactoring a database.
   <p>
   Let's add to our sample database a new table that stores information about
   rooms.
   For each room a number identifying the room and a list of courses held in
   that room should be stored.
   The following program code adds the <a
   href="sources.html#RoomTable"><code>RoomTable</code></a> under the name
   <q>Room</q> to our sample database which is assumed to be saved in the
   <q>dbDir</q> directory:
   
   <pre><code>   Refactor.addTable(Paths.get("dbDir/layout"), "Room",
                  new RoomTable(), Refactor.names().
                  add("Number").add("Courses", "Course"));</code></pre>
   
   Note, that the column types of the Room table are defined in the
   <code>RoomTable</code> class but the names of the columns (<q>Number</q> and
   <q>Courses</q>) as well as the name of the referenced Course table ("Course")
   must be specified using an instance of the
   <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Refactor.Names.html"
   target="_blank"><code>Refactor.Names</code></a> class.
   <p>
   Refactoring changes the database layout: At the very end of the
   <a href="layout2.html" target="_blank">database layout file</a> you will find
   the table layout for the just added Room table.
   </p>
   <p>
   As a second example we change the type of the Salary column in the Teacher
   table from <code>BigInteger</code> to <code>Double</code> and no longer
   allow <code>null</code> values to be stored in that column:
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   Refactor.modifyColumn(Paths.get("dbDir/layout"), null,
          "Teacher", "Salary", CL.ofDouble(Nulls.NO_NULL),
                 big -> ((BigInteger) big).doubleValue());</code></pre>
   
   Remarks:
   <ol>
      <li>
      The expression <code>CL.ofDouble(Nulls.NO_NULL)</code> defines the Salary
      column to be of type <code>Double</code>, rejecting <code>null</code>
      values.
      </li>
      <li>
      Existing <code>BigInteger</code> values are converted to <code>Double</code>
      values according to the lambda expression <code>big -> ((BigInteger)
      big).doubleValue()</code>.
      </li>
	</ol>
   As in the first example, this modification affects the <a href="layout3.html"
   target="_blank">database layout file</a>:
   At the position where the Salary column of the Taeacher table is described,
   the value of the entry <code>typeDesc</code> is changed from
   <code>BigIntegerni20v</code> to <code>d!i8</code> and the no longer needed
   entry
   
   <pre><code>   typeFactoryClassName = example.db.BigIntegerType</code></pre>
   
   is removed.
   <p>
   Opening the modified database as a <em>weakly</em> typed database is no
   problem.
   However, opening the database as a <em>strongly</em> typed database throws
   an exception.
   The reason is that the
   <a href="sources.html#TeacherTable"><code>TeacherTable</code></a> class
   defines the Salary column still to be of type <code>BigInteger</code>:
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   public static final Column&lt;BigInteger&gt; SALARY =
                CL.create(new BigIntegerType(20, NULLABLE));</code></pre>
   
   In order for the modified database to match the table logic again, we have
   to replace this declaration with
   
   <pre><code>   public static final Column&lt;Double&gt; SALARY =
                                       CL.ofDouble(NO_NULL);</code></pre>
   
   But what about existing client code that still assumes the Salary column to
   be of type <code>BigInteger</code>?
   Well, due to the strong typing of the column, this mismatch is conveniently
   reported to the programmer at compile time.
   (See the discussion in Section
   <q><a href="opening.html#section1">Strongly and Weakly Typed</a></q> of
   Chapter <q><a href="opening.html">Opening</a></q>.)
   <p>
   Besides the methods <code>addTable</code> and <code>modifyColumn</code>
   presented here, the <code>Refactor</code> class includes the methods
   <code>dropTable</code>, <code>dropColumn</code>, and
   <code>insertColumn</code>.
   For further information consult the <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/Refactor.html"
   target="_blank">javadoc</a>.
   </p>
   We also refer to the javadoc regarding the methods <code>nobsRowRef</code>,
   <code>nobsOutrowPtr</code>, and <code>nobsRefCount</code>, which make it
   possible to fundamentally re-dimension a table.
   The <a href="../javadoc/acdp/tools/KeyFigures.html"
   target="_blank"><code>KeyFigures</code></a> class prints for each table the
   values of these parameters and by how much they can be reduced given the
   amount of data currently stored in the database.

<section id="section4">
   <h2>Checking Integrity</h2>
   ACDP relies on the computer's file system.
   If ACDP behaves strangely, a reason may be that changes were made to
   database files from outside of ACDP, harming the integrity of the database.
   (The individual integrity constraints are highly technical in nature.
   Their explanation is beyond the scope of this tutorial.)
   <p>
   The method <a
   href="../javadoc/acdp/misc/ACDP.html#verify(java.nio.file.Path,boolean,boolean)"
   target="_blank"><code>boolean ACDP.verify(Path layoutFile, boolean fix,
   boolean report)</code></a> checks the integrity of the database specified by
   the <code>layoutFile</code> argument and, if <code>fix</code> is set to
   <code>true</code> and there is an integrity violation, ACDP tries to repair
   the database.
   For example, to check the integrity of the <q>Edu</q> database invoke
   </p>
   
   <pre><code>   ACDP.verify(Paths.get("dbDir/layout"), false, true);</code></pre>
   
   If no integrity violations are detected this code returns <code>true</code>
   and prints the following report:

   <pre><samp>   Checking database "Edu" ...
      Checking table "Course" (1 of 4) ...
      Completed - No violations detected.
      Checking table "Student" (2 of 4) ...
      Completed - No violations detected.
      Checking table "Teacher" (3 of 4) ...
      Completed - No violations detected.
      Checking table "Contact" (4 of 4) ...
      Completed - No violations detected.
   Completed - No violations detected.</samp></pre>
